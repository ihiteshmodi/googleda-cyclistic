# googleda-cyclistic
Part of the Google data analytics professional certification capstone project.

# Context:
1) I am a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.
2) Hypothesis = companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships as annual members are more profitable than casual riders


## -> Additional points that we should know
1) 30% of the users use bikes to commute to work everyday rest use for leisure.
2) We have only 2 types of customer = Members, Casual riders.



# Questions to answer through this analysis
## 1) Is the hypothesis (Registered members are more profitable than casual bikers) Valid?
## 2) What are the behavioural differences between Members and casual bikers?
## 3) Formulate a strategy for converting casual members to paid membership types.



# Appendix
1) Data sourced from -> Divvy 1 year data from 2019 quarter 2 to 2020 quarter 1 [Link to dataset](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
2) Data Cleaned, Concatenated etc etc... using the attached python file
3) Data trimmed using Sql
4) Data visualized Using tableau (workbook link - [Tableau Public worksheet link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hitesh.modi/viz/Cyclistbikeshare/TotalridelengthByDays)
  -> Note - All the slides marked with X were dropped as they did not help answering the original question (Strategy to convery casual riders to paid members)
5) Presentation made for Stakeholders - [Google slide link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17K5YBRZl-SHqHk5CPAyMjnZv6rBayC_2p7EA5ytEvXg/edit?usp=sharing)



## Conclusions from the presentation
1) Hypothesis was dropped due to less availablity of data
   -> We did not have data regarding revenues, profits, bike idle (opportunity cost), mentainance cost of bikes etc etc due to which we were not abel to ascertain the profits           generated from each category of the riders
2) We did find some behaviousal differences between the different category of customers
3) Those behaviour differenced would have worked great if we were working on an advertising / marketing campaing however, they fail to help us build a strategy on "How to convert casual riders to paid members"
